# AmazonEosMatrixSolutionFinal

The solution is implemented as one test with 5 different UA steps, as described in the conditions of the PDF task.
I have not implemented an entire testing framework, due to the condition of only 5 different UA steps, that have been fitted into 1 test. 
At line 62 I had problems on my own computer with cookies, due to the specific settings of Amazon site. The test is working correctly, if cookies are setup correctly. If you are having trouble with cookies, you can reset your settings on Google Chrome to Default Settings. 
At UA4, the page details are different than the ones shown in the PDF task. I have implemented the steps, according to the new page details. 
AT UA4, lines 89 to 94, if cookies are not setup correctly, gift option may not appear at all and cause the test to fail. 
AT UA5, lines 112 to 117, I implemented two checks, so that both subtotals are verified to be correct.
